## What is this ?

This is my solutions for andrewNg's Machine Learning [Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) assignments.

## Things that helped me solve :

 - Tom Mosher's [Tutorials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/all/threads/m0ZdvjSrEeWddiIAC9pDDA)
 - The Implementation Tips in the assignments pdf

## The file structure :

The assignments are only writing the core algorithms. As for the redundant stuff like loading the datasets and the libraries, it's already done for you.
So the files you should be interested in are the ones that are marked with an asterisk (*) in the first page of every pdf file.
